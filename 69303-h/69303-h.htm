<h3>
THE LIFE OF MICHELANGELO
</h3>

<p>
In the quaintly written diary of Messer
Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni, a well-to-do Florentine
citizen, the following entry, dated March 6th,
1475, may still be found: "To-day there was born
unto me a male child, whom I have named
Michelagnolo.[<a id="chap04fn1text"></a><a href="#chap04fn1">1</a>]  He saw the light at Caprese,
whereof I am Podestà, on Monday morning, 6th
March, between four and five o'clock, and on
the 8th of the same month he was baptized in
the church of San Giovanni."  Messer Lodovico
had been appointed <i>Podestà</i>, or Governor, of
Chiusi and Caprese in the Casentino by Lorenzo
de Medici only a few months before penning this
memorandum, so that, by a strange caprice of
fate, it was here, in the little town overshadowed
by the rugged Sasso della Verna, hallowed by
the ecstatic visions of St. Francis of Assisi, and
not in Florence, in the Athens of the Italian
Renaissance, where resurrected Paganism ran
riot and triumphed, that the longest and most
glorious career in the history of art and of human
endeavour began.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap04fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap04fn1text">1</a>] This is the archaic form of <i>angelo</i>.  The name is also
sometimes spelt <i>Michelangiolo</i>, but I have thought it
advisable to adopt the modern and more generally accepted
<i>Michelangelo</i>.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Vasari and Condivi, Michelangelo's pupils and
enthusiastic biographers, maintain that the
Buonarroti family was closely related to the great
house of the Counts of Canossa, a conviction
fully shared, curiously enough, by the artist
himself, who rather prided himself on his aristocratic
connection.  But recent genealogical researches
have proved beyond all doubt that, although of
gentle birth (both his father and his mother,
Madonna Francesca di Miniato Del Sera, coming of
ancient Florentine stock), Michelangelo could
not in reality lay claim to even distant ties of
kinship with the Canossa family.
</p>

<p>
On the expiration of his term of office as
Podestà of Caprese, which extended little over a
year, Messer Lodovico returned with his family
to Settignano, the picturesque little village built
on a vine-clad slope overlooking Florence, where,
in an old-fashioned mansion nestling among olive
trees and surrounded by a well-cultivated <i>podere</i>,
many generations of the Buonarroti had lived
and died.  Before leaving Caprese, however, the
proud father had the child's horoscope cast, and
greatly did he rejoice when the astrologer
announced that a singularly lucky combination of
the planets had presided over the birth of his
boy, who was destined "to perform wonders
with his mind and with his hands," a prophecy
which was amply fulfilled.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3b">
FIRST FLORENTINE PERIOD
</p>

<p>
The removal of the Buonarroti family to
Settignano, the little village almost exclusively
inhabited by stonemasons and workers in marble,
exercised a most decisive influence on the child's
future career.  Indeed, Michelangelo himself used
to say half jestingly, that as he had been given
out to nurse to a stonemason's wife, the mania
for sculpture must have entered his blood together
with the milk which he had sucked as a babe.  A
mallet and a chisel and bits of marble were the only
toys that the infant Michelangelo cared for, and it
is recorded of him that when he grew up to be a
sturdy boy of ten he could use his tools almost
as skilfully as his foster-father himself.  He soon
became more ambitious, and would pass whole
hours with chalk and charcoal, trying to copy the
marble figures and ornaments plentifully strewn
about.
</p>

<p>
For it was a busy time at Settignano, whose
hundreds of stone-carvers were hardly able to cope
with the numerous commissions which poured
in upon them from the merchant princes of
Florence, anxious to rival Lorenzo the
Magnificent in the building and decoration of
splendid palaces.  A spirited drawing of a faun by
Michelangelo's boyish hand may still be seen on
a wall of the Buonarroti Villa.
</p>

<p>
Messer Lodovico did everything in his power
to discourage these marked artistic tendencies,
and in order the better to uproot what he regarded
as a worthless inclination, he sent the boy to a
grammar-school in Florence, away from the
dangerous <i>milieu</i> of Settignano, with its
unceasing din of hammer and chisel on reverberating
marble, which was sweet music to Michelangelo's
ear.  But although Maestro Francesco da Urbino,
to whose care Messer Lodovico had entrusted
his son, frequently had recourse to the most
persuasive and forcible arguments, they were entirely
lost on young Michelangelo, who had instinctively
drifted into the company of the garzoni and pupils
of leading Florentine artists, and sadly neglected
his books in order to devote himself with growing
enthusiasm to the study of art.
</p>

<p>
Amongst his new friends was Francesco Granacci,
a pupil of Domenico Ghirlandajo, who often
lent him drawings to copy, and took him to his
master's <i>bottega</i> whenever any work was going
forward from which he might learn.  "So
powerfully," says Condivi, "did these sights move
Michelangelo, that he altogether abandoned
letters; so that his father, who held art in
contempt, often beat him severely for it."  But it soon
became apparent that blows and persuasion were
equally unavailing, and Messer Lodovico finally
gave up the hopeless struggle, apprenticing his
thirteen-year-old son on April 1st, 1488, to
Domenico and David Ghirlandajo, reputed the best
painters of the time in Florence.  Although a
mere child, Michelangelo was evidently already
able to make himself useful in the studio, for
instead of paying a certain sum for his apprenticeship,
as was usually the case, it was stipulated
that he should receive twenty-four florins, about
£8 12<i>s.</i>, during the three years of its duration.
</p>

<p>
Michelangelo's first picture was a strikingly
faithful copy of Martin Schongauer's famous
<i>Temptation of St. Antony</i>, which he painted with
a realistic force considered wonderful for a child
of his age.  A number of anecdotes illustrative of
the precocity of the boy's genius, are related by
Condivi and by Vasari.  "Michelangelo," says
the latter, "grew in power and character so
rapidly that Domenico was astonished seeing him
do things quite extraordinary in a youth, for he
not only surpassed the other students, but often
equalled the work done by his master.  It
happened that Domenico was working in the great
chapel of Santa Maria Novella, and one day when
he was out Michelangelo set himself to draw from
nature the scaffolding, the tables with all the
materials of the art, and some of the young men
at work.  Presently Domenico returned, and saw
Michelangelo's drawing.  He was astonished,
saying 'this boy knows more than I do;' and he
was stupefied by this style and new realism; 'a
gift from heaven to a child of such tender years.'"
</p>

<p>
Michelangelo derived very little advantage
from his apprenticeship to Domenico Ghirlandajo,
who was actually jealous of his pupil and
gave him little or no assistance in his studies.  He
may have picked up some practical knowledge,
however, transferring cartoons for his master in
the church of Santa Maria Novella, painting
draperies and ornaments, mixing colours for
fresco painting, and generally fulfilling the rather
menial duties which fell to the lot of an artist's
apprentice in those days.  The boy had no fixed
plan or method of study, but devoted himself
principally to drawing, in which he soon acquired
a boldness and security of line never attained by
his master, whose faulty cartoons Michelangelo
often had the courage to correct.
</p>

<p>
It was in the gardens of the Medici at San
Marco, where Lorenzo the Magnificent had collected
many antique statues and decorative sculptures,
that Michelangelo finally discovered his real
artistic vocation, and here he would spend many
hours every day, assimilating the Hellenic spirit
which emanated from the masterpieces before him.
</p>

<p>
Lorenzo's principal object in establishing a
museum of antique sculpture at San Marco had
been to raise Florentine sculpture from the state
of comparative neglect into which it had fallen
since the death of Donatello.  He therefore
appointed one Bertoldo, who had been foreman
of Donatello's workshop, keeper of the collection,
with a special commission to encourage and
instruct the young men who studied there.  But
there was evidently a great lack of students, for
Lorenzo had recourse to Domenico Ghirlandajo,
requesting him to select from his pupils those he
considered the most promising, and send them
to work in the garden of San Marco.  Domenico,
nothing loth to get rid of his two most ambitious
apprentices, selected Francesco Granacci and
Michelangelo, and it was thus that the latter
came under the influence of Donatello's school.
Of Bertoldo, who must be considered Michelangelo's
first instructor in the art of sculpture,
and who doubtless had a great share in shaping
his genius, very little is known beyond Vasari's
statement that "although he was old and could
not work, he was none the less an able and
highly reputed artist."  The magnificent pulpits
of San Lorenzo, begun by Donatello and completed
by Bertoldo, amply suffice to confirm
Vasari's eulogistic estimate.
</p>

<p>
Under such a master Michelangelo made rapid
progress, and by his first attempt at sculpture, a
mask of a grinning Faun, attracted the attention
of Lorenzo the Magnificent, who took the keenest
interest in the art school which he had founded.
So struck was Lorenzo with the boy's genius, that
he prevailed upon Messer Lodovico, not without
the greatest difficulty, to entrust the talented young
sculptor to his care.  Vasari tells us that "he
gave Michelangelo a good room in his own house
with all that he needed, treating him like a son,
with a seat at his table, which was frequented
every day by noblemen and men of great importance."
</p>

PORTRAIT OF MICHELANGELO.
</p>

<p>
Michelangelo's daily companions at this
hospitable board were such men as Pico della
Mirandola, surnamed "the prince of wisdom,"
Marsilio Ficino, the expounder of Plato, and the
poets Luigi Pulci and Angelo Poliziano.  It was
the latter who suggested the subject of Michelangelo's
first important work, a bas-relief, now in
the Casa Buonarroti, representing the <i>Battle of
the Centaurs and Lapithae</i>.  It is a singularly
powerful composition, conceived and carried out
with a freedom and originality little short of
miraculous in a boy of fifteen.  The struggling
groups of combatants, instinct with life and
energy, the masterful treatment of anatomical
problems, and the already profound knowledge
of the human frame, reveal the future author of
the <i>Last Judgment</i>.
</p>

<p>
Michelangelo himself, when at the height of
his artistic greatness, used to say that he had
never quite fulfilled the splendid promise
contained in this youthful work of his.  Apart from
its intrinsic merit, this bas-relief is interesting as
illustrating Michelangelo's complete independence
from the school and methods of Donatello.
His bold and original genius had sought inspiration
directly from the antique, and the <i>Battle of
the Centaurs and Lapithae</i> might easily be taken
for a fragment from some Roman sarcophagus.
In view of these very pronounced characteristics,
it is difficult to understand why another
bas-relief, also in the Casa Buonarroti, representing
a seated Madonna with the Infant Jesus, and
chiefly notable for its almost servile imitation of
Donatello's manner, should be ascribed by most
critics to this same period.  Indeed, the
execution and design of this <i>Madonna and Child</i> are
so inferior as to render it a work of extremely
doubtful authenticity.
</p>

<p>
Although he applied himself principally to the
study of sculpture, Michelangelo continued to
devote many hours every day to drawing, and, like
most young artists of his age, he drew and studied
assiduously in the Brancacci Chapel of the
Church of the Carmine, containing the famous
frescoes of Masaccio and his followers.  Conscious
of his own superiority, Michelangelo was,
it appears, in the habit of frankly criticizing the
work of his fellow-students in the Brancacci
Chapel, and one of these, named Piero Torrigiani,
a brutal and proud fellow, got so angry
one day that he hit Michelangelo a formidable
blow on the nose, breaking the cartilage and
disfiguring his critic for life.  For this act of temper
Torrigiani was banished from Florence, but it is
pleasant to know that Michelangelo successfully
interceded with Lorenzo on behalf of the man
who had assaulted him.
</p>

<p>
Michelangelo had just completed the <i>Battle
of the Centaurs and Lapithae</i> when he lost his
best friend and munificent patron, to whom he
had become deeply attached.  On April 8th, 1492,
Lorenzo the Magnificent died at Careggi, sincerely
mourned, not only in Florence, but throughout
Italy.  The generous encouragement which
he gave to art and letters, the power and
splendour which he bestowed on Florence in exchange
for her lost liberty, more as an infatuated lover
dowering a wayward bride than as a conqueror
imposing his will, the consummate ability
displayed in his diplomatic dealings with the other
Italian States, these were the principal merits
which justified the proud title of <i>Il Magnifico</i>,
conferred on him by his contemporaries, and
which caused Lorenzo's death to be regarded as
a public calamity throughout Italy.
</p>

<p>
So much grief, says Condivi, did Michelangelo
feel for his patron's death, that for some time he
was quite unable to work.  He left the Medicean
palace, which had been his home during three
years, and returned to his father's house.  But
his love for art was stronger than his grief, and
after a few weeks, when he was himself again,
he bought a large piece of marble that had for
many years been exposed to the wind and rain,
and carved a Hercules out of it.  This statue
was placed in the Strozzi Palace, where it stood
until the siege of Florence in 1530, when Giovanni
Battista della Palla bought it and sent it
into France as a gift to King Francis I.  It has
unfortunately been lost.
</p>

<p>
At this time Michelangelo applied himself
most diligently to the study of anatomy, a
profound knowledge of which is apparent in all his
subsequent works.  He was indebted to the Prior
of Santo Spirito for many kindnesses, amongst
others for the use of a room where he dissected
the subjects, for the most part executed criminals,
which the Prior placed at his disposal.  "Nothing,"
says Condivi, "could have given Michelangelo
more pleasure, and this was the beginning
of his anatomical studies, which he followed
until he had completely mastered the secrets of
the human frame."
</p>

<p>
It is surprising that artists of the Cinquecento
should have enjoyed privileges for practically
studying anatomy which were denied to
physicians.  When the famous Dr. Hunter saw
Leonardo da Vinci's anatomical drawings and their
descriptions, preserved in the library of George
III., he discovered with astonishment that the
artist had been a deep student, "and was at that
time the best anatomist in the world."  Michelangelo,
as Vasari tells us, "dissected many dead
bodies, zealously studying anatomy," whereas
Cortesius, professor of anatomy at Bologna, who
wrote a century later, complains that he was
prevented finishing a treatise on "Practical
Anatomy" in consequence of having only been able
twice to dissect a human body in the course of
twenty-four years.  To please his friend the Prior,
Michelangelo carved a crucifix in wood, a little
under life size, which was placed over the high
altar of the church of Santo Spirito, but which
has since been lost.
</p>

<p>
Piero de' Medici, the Magnifico's son and
successor, had inherited none of his father's
brilliant qualities.  He was proud and insolent,
and his coarse tastes and manners soon lost him
that popularity which had been Lorenzo's
stepping-stone to greatness.  Michelangelo, who had
been his companion as a boy, and whom he
persuaded to accept his hospitality, was ill at ease
in the house of a Prince who could so far insult
the sensitive artist as to boast that he had two
remarkable men in his establishment, Michelangelo
and a certain Spanish groom remarkable
for his athletic prowess, thus placing both on the
same level.
</p>

<p>
Too proud to tolerate such treatment, and
foreseeing Piero's approaching fall, Michelangelo
left Florence early in the year 1494 and went
first to Venice, where he failed to find
employment, and thence to Bologna.  Here he was
hospitably received by a gentleman named
Messer Gian Francesco Aldovrandi, who not only
paid a fine of fifty Bolognese lire to which the
impecunious young sculptor had been condemned
for having neglected to provide himself
with a passport, but invited him to his house and
honoured him highly, "delighting in his genius,
and every evening he made him read something
from Dante or from Petrarca, or now and then
from Boccaccio, until he fell asleep."
</p>

<p>
While staying with Aldovrandi, and thanks to
his recommendation, Michelangelo completed an
unfinished statue of San Petronio in the church of
San Domenico and carved a statuette of a kneeling
angel holding a candlestick for the arca or
shrine of the saint, begun by Nicolò di Bari.  It
is a beautiful and highly finished work, which
was greatly admired and for which he received
thirty ducats.  His success aroused the fierce
jealousy of the Bolognese sculptors, and it was
under fear of personal violence from the native
craftsmen, who accused him of taking the bread
out of their mouths, that Michelangelo hastily
left Bologna in the spring of 1495 and returned
to Florence.
</p>

<p>
In November of the preceding year Piero de'
Medici had had to fly from the city over whose
destinies he was so unfit to preside, and when
Michelangelo returned to Florence he found that
Savonarola had established a popular government.
The fiery Dominican, with his inspired
eloquence, his ascetic fervour and an energy
bordering upon violence, was exactly a man after
Michelangelo's heart, and Savonarola's
impassioned and gloomy appeals made an indelible
impression upon him.  The <i>Last Judgment</i> in the
Sistine Chapel might almost be regarded as a
pictorial rendering of one of the terrible frate's
sermons.
</p>

<p>
Although only twenty years of age, Michelangelo,
of whom it has been said "that he was
never young," was made a member of the General
Council of Citizens.  But his political duties did
not take up much of his time, for to this period
must be ascribed the statue of a youthful
St. John the Baptist, executed for Lorenzo di Pier
Francesco, a cousin of the exiled Medici, and
now in the Berlin Museum.  It is a charming but
somewhat effeminate figure, differing strangely
from the powerful and rugged style to which we
are accustomed in Michelangelo's works.  Lorenzo,
however, was delighted with it and became
a staunch friend and admirer of the young sculptor,
whose studio he frequently visited.  On one
occasion he found Michelangelo at work on a
<i>Sleeping Cupid</i> so perfectly modelled and
conceived in a spirit so truly Hellenic, as to appear
a masterpiece of antique art.  Lorenzo suggested
that Michelangelo should make it look as if it had
been buried under the earth for many centuries,
so that the statue, being taken for a genuine
antique, would sell much better, and the artist,
more out of professional pride than in hopes of
gain, followed his friend's suggestion.  <i>The
Sleeping Cupid</i> was sent to Rome, where Raffaelo
Riario, Cardinal di San Giorgio, bought it as an
antique for two hundred ducats, an evidence not
so much of the Cardinal's ignorance as of
Michelangelo's careful study of classical art.
</p>

<p>
This work was indirectly the cause of Michelangelo's
first coming to Rome, for the Cardinal
having discovered that his Cupid had been
made in Florence was at first very angry at
having been fooled, and insisted on the dealer,
Baldassare del Milanese, taking back the statue
and refunding the two hundred ducats (of which
sum, by the way, Michelangelo had only received
thirty ducats), but when his anger had subsided,
the prelate, who was a liberal patron of art,
shrewdly concluded that a sculptor who could
so well imitate the antique was worth encouraging,
and he forthwith despatched one of his
gentlemen to Florence for the express purpose
of discovering the mysterious forger and bringing
him to Rome.
</p>

<p>
The Cardinal's emissary, after much fruitless
search, chanced upon Michelangelo in his studio,
and was so struck with the masterful manner in
which the young sculptor made a pen-drawing of
a hand in his presence, that he began to
cross-examine him discreetly about his other works,
and gradually learned all the story of the Cupid.
Michelangelo, who longed to see Rome, which
his visitor extolled as the widest field for an artist
to study and to show his genius in, readily
consented to leave Florence.  In fact it appears that
he was not very popular among his fellow-citizens
owing to his former intimacy with the exiled
Medici, and so, towards the end of June, 1496,
he set foot in Rome for the first time.  As to the
<i>Sleeping Cupid</i>, nothing is known about its fate
beyond the fact that it fell into the hands of Cesare
Borgia at the sack of Urbino in 1592, and was
by him presented to the Marchioness of Mantua,
who in acknowledging the gift describes it as
"without a peer among the works of modern
times."
</p>

<p>
Michelangelo was greatly disappointed in his
hopes of obtaining lucrative employment from
Cardinal Riario.  Indeed, the only work which
he did during the first few weeks of his sojourn
consisted in a cartoon for a <i>Saint Francis receiving
the Stigmata</i>, to be painted by the Cardinal's
barber!  Fortunately for the young artist a
wealthy Roman gentleman, Messer Jacopo Galli,
came to his rescue, commissioning a <i>Bacchus</i>,
which is now in the National Museum at
Florence, and a <i>Cupid</i>, believed by some to be the
statue now in the Victoria and Albert Museum,
South Kensington.  Of all Michelangelo's works,
this <i>Bacchus</i> is certainly the most realistic and
least dignified, representing as it does a youth in
the first stage of intoxication, holding a cup in
his right hand and in his left a bunch of grapes,
from which a mischievous little Satyr is slily
helping himself.
</p>

<p>
The statue was greatly admired in Rome and
was the means of bringing Michelangelo to the
notice of the French king's envoy in Rome,
Cardinal De la Groslaye de Villiers, who
commissioned him to carve a marble group of <i>Our
Lady holding the dead Christ in her arms</i>, for
the price of four hundred and fifty golden
ducats.  The contract, dated August 26th, 1498,
is still preserved in the Archivio Buonarroti, and
concludes with these words: "And I, Jacopo
Gallo, promise to his Most Reverend Lordship
that the said Michelangelo will furnish the said
work within one year, and that it shall be the
most beautiful work in marble which Rome
to-day can show, and that no master of our days
shall be able to produce a better."  We shall see,
when describing this magnificent group, that
Jacopo's boast and promise were more than
justified.
</p>

<p>
While in Rome, Michelangelo kept up an
active correspondence with Messer Lodovico,
who, it appears, found himself in great financial
straits at this time.  Being a most dutiful and
affectionate son, the young sculptor sent every
available scudo of his money to succour his
father and his three younger brothers, namely
Buonarroto, born in 1477, whom he placed in
the Arte della Seta; Giovan Simone, born in
1479, who led a vagabond life and was a source
of continual trouble, and Sigismondo, born in
1481, who became a soldier.  The letters which
Michelangelo, in the midst of his artistic labours,
found time to write home, full of tender solicitude
and good advice and invariably containing a
remittance, give us a touching insight into the
beautiful and disinterested character which lay
hidden underneath his stern and decidedly
unattractive exterior.
</p>

<p>
He lived not only very economically, but
penuriously, in order the better to help his family,
and it appears that his health suffered not a little
from these privations.  His father heard of it,
and wrote a letter, dated December 19th, 1500,
in which these passages occur: "Economy is
good, but above all do not be penurious; live
moderately and do not stint yourself, and avoid
hardships, because in your art, if you fall ill
(which God forbid), you are a lost man.  Above
all things, never wash; have yourself rubbed
down, but never wash!"
</p>

<p>
When Michelangelo returned to Florence in
the spring of 1501, the fame of the great works
which he had accomplished in Rome had already
preceded him, and he was generally admitted to
be the first sculptor of the day.  Commissions
came pouring in upon him, including one from
Cardinal Francesco Piccolomini, who afterwards
became Pope Pius III., for fifteen statues of saints
to adorn the Piccolomini Chapel in the Duomo
of Siena.
</p>

<p>
But he completely neglected this work in order
to devote himself with characteristic ardour to a
more congenial task, that of carving a colossal
statue of David out of a huge block of marble
which had been previously spoiled by an inferior
artist and abandoned as useless in the Opera del
Duomo.  Surmounting the enormous technical
difficulties which he had to contend with, Michelangelo
succeeded, after nearly two years of hard
work, in evolving from the crippled block of
marble one of the greatest masterpieces of
modern art.
</p>

<p>
On the 14th of May, 1504, <i>Il Gigante</i>, as it
was called by the Florentines, left Michelangelo's
workshop and was dragged with much difficulty
to the Piazza della Signoria, where it stood until
the year 1873, when it was removed to the hall
of the Accademia delle Belle Arti.  It has fortunately
suffered very little from its exposure in the
mild Florentine air, but the left arm was shattered
by a stone during the tumults of 1527.  The
broken pieces were carefully collected, however,
by Vasari and a young sculptor, Cecchino De'
Rossi, who restored the arm in 1543.  Another
giant David in bronze was commissioned to
Michelangelo in 1502 by the Republic, who
wished to make a present of it to a French statesman,
Florimond Robertet, but although this work
is known to have remained for more than a
hundred years in the château of Bury, near Blois, it
has since disappeared.
</p>

<p>
While wrestling with the difficulties of his
<i>David</i>, Michelangelo found time to accomplish
many other important works, including two marble
tondi in bas-relief, the first of which is now in the
National Museum at Florence and the other in
the Royal Academy, London.  Both represent
the <i>Madonna and Child with the Infant St. John</i>,
and although lacking in finish they deserve to
rank among the finest of Michelangelo's works.
The composition is beautiful and simple, the
modelling bold and the expression of the
Madonna singularly noble and striking.
</p>

<p>
In April, 1503, Michelangelo was commissioned
by the Operai of the Duomo to carve out
of Carrara marble twelve colossal statues of the
Apostles, one to be finished each year, and a
workshop was specially built for the sculptor in
the Borgo Pinti, but the contract could not be
carried out, the unfinished <i>St. Matthew</i>, now in
the courtyard of the Accademia, in Florence,
being the only work which resulted from this
commission: "And in order not altogether to give
up painting," says Condivi, "he executed a round
panel of Our Lady for Messer Agnolo Doni, a
Florentine citizen, for which he received seventy
ducats."  This tondo, representing <i>The Holy
Family</i>, with nude figures in the background, is
now in the Uffizi Gallery, and apart from its
originality and artistic merit, it is especially
interesting as being the only easel picture which
may be attributed with absolute certainty to
Michelangelo.
</p>

<p>
In August, 1504, Michelangelo was commissioned
by his friend and protector, Piero Soderini,
Gonfaloniere of the Republic, to decorate a wall
in the Sala del Gran Consiglio in the Palazzo
Vecchio, a most flattering compliment to the
young artist, as Leonardo da Vinci, then at the
height of his fame, was already engaged in preparing
cartoons for the opposite wall.  Leonardo's
designs represented the famous <i>Fight for the
Standard</i>, an episode of the battle of Anghiari,
fought in 1440, when the Florentines defeated
Niccolò Piccinino.  Michelangelo selected for
his subject an episode in the war with Pisa, which
gave him an opportunity to display his wonderful
draughtsmanship and his profound knowledge
of the human frame.
</p>

<p>
Benvenuto Cellini, who copied the cartoon in
1513, just before its mysterious disappearance,
describes it as follows: "Michelangelo portrayed
a number of foot soldiers who, the season being
summer, had gone to bathe in the Arno.  He drew
them at the moment the alarm is sounded, and
the men, all naked, rush to arms.  So splendid is
their action that nothing survives of ancient or of
modern art which touches the same lofty point
of excellence; and, as I have already said, the
design of the great Leonardo was itself most
admirably beautiful.  These two cartoons stood,
one in the Palace of the Medici, the other in the
hall of the Pope.  So long as they remained
intact they were the school of the world.  Though
the divine Michelangelo in later life finished that
great chapel of Pope Julius, he never rose halfway
to the same pitch of power; his genius never
afterwards attained to the force of those first
studies."
</p>

<p>
Leonardo, after having begun painting a group
of horsemen on the wall, abandoned the task
with characteristic fickleness, and Michelangelo
having been summoned to Rome in the beginning
of 1505 by Pope Julius II., left his work
unfinished.  It is said that a worthless rival named
Baccio Bandinelli, envious of Michelangelo's
greatness, destroyed the famous cartoon of Pisa.
A sketch of the whole composition may be seen
in the Albertina Gallery at Vienna, but perhaps
the most complete copy of the cartoon is the
monochrome painting belonging to the Earl of
Leicester, at Holkham Hall.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3b">
THE TRAGEDY OF THE TOMB
</p>

<p>
Michelangelo little suspected when he left
Florence that he was bidding adieu for ever to
his happiness and peace of mind.  Hitherto he
had had to deal with generous tyrants, such as
the Medici, with rivals whose envy was shorn of
dangers by their cowardice, and with a protector
such as Piero Soderini, whom Machiavelli taunted
with being a weakling only fit for the Limbo of
Infants.  It was not until he came to Rome that
he was brought face to face with a man blessed
or cursed with indomitable energy, boundless
ambition and a morbid restlessness which was
probably the resultant of these two forces.  Both
Julius II. and Michelangelo were what their
contemporaries called <i>uomini terribili</i>, proud,
passionate, given to sudden bursts of fury, yet generous
withal and truly great.  For two such men to live
together in uninterrupted peace and goodwill
would have been a sheer impossibility.
</p>

<p>
After some months of hesitation, Julius
II. finally decided upon the best way of employing
Michelangelo's talents.  He resolved to have a
magnificent monument erected during his lifetime,
and confided the task to the young sculptor.
In an incredibly short time Michelangelo
prepared his great design, which pleased the Pope
so much that he at once sent him to Carrara to
quarry the necessary marble.  During the eight
months which he spent at Carrara, Michelangelo
blocked out two of the figures for the tomb, so
anxious was he to begin his colossal work.
</p>

<p>
In November Michelangelo returned to Rome,
where a house and spacious workshop were as
signed to him near the Vatican, and in January,
1506, most of the marble, which had come by
water, was spread all over the Piazza of St. Peter's:
"This immense quantity of marble," says
Condivi, "was the admiration of all and a joy to the
Pope, who heaped immeasurable favours upon
Michelangelo, and was so interested in his work
that he ordered a drawbridge to be thrown across
from the Corridore to the rooms of Michelangelo,
by which he might visit him in private."
</p>

<p>
Michelangelo's original project of the tomb
subsequently underwent so many modifications
and reductions, that Condivi's account of what
the monument should have been is deeply
interesting: "The tomb was to have had four faces,
two of eighteen braccia, that served for the flanks,
so that it was to be a square and a half in plan.
All round about the outside were niches for
statues, and between niche and niche terminal
figures; to these were bound other statues, like
prisoners, upon certain square plinths, rising
from the ground and projecting from the monument.
They represented the liberal arts, each
with her symbol, denoting that, like Pope Julius,
all the virtues were the prisoners of Death,
because they would never find such favour and
encouragement as he gave them.  Above these
ran the cornice that tied all the work together.
On its plane were four great statues; one of these,
the Moses, may be seen in San Pietro ad Vincula.
So the work mounted upward until it ended in
a plane.  Upon it were two angels who supported
an arc; one appeared to be smiling as though he
rejoiced that the soul of the Pope had been
received amongst the blessed spirits, the other
wept, as if sad that the world had been deprived
of such a man.  Above one end was the entrance
to the sepulchre in a small chamber, built like a
temple; in the middle was a marble sarcophagus,
where the body of the Pope was to be buried;
everything worked out with marvellous art.
Briefly, more than forty statues went to the whole
work, not counting the subjects in mezzo rilievo
to be cast in bronze, all appropriate in their
stories and proclaiming the acts of this great
Pontiff."
</p>

<p>
As the monument would have covered an area
of about 34½ feet by 23 feet, the church of
St. Peter, although restored by Nicholas V., was
found to be too small to contain it, and Julius
II. decided to rebuild the whole church on a more
magnificent scale, after designs prepared by
Bramante.
</p>

<p>
The eager enthusiasm with which Michelangelo
attacked his colossal task was not destined
to last long.  One day a quantity of marble arrived
from Carrara, and Michelangelo, desiring at once
to pay the freight and porterage, went to ask the
Pope for money, but found his Holiness occupied.
He paid the men out of his own pocket,
but when he returned on several succeeding days
he found access to the Vatican more difficult
than usual, and finally learned that the Pope had
given orders that he should not be admitted.
Julius II., always entangled in warlike adventures,
was evidently short of money and could not or
would not pay Michelangelo at the time.  The
proud and short-tempered sculptor flew into a
passion, and exclaiming that "henceforward the
Pope must look for him elsewhere if he wanted
him," took horse at once and returned to
Florence, vainly pursued by five messengers from
the Pope.
</p>

<p>
It was thus that the gigantic work on which
he had set his heart was interrupted for the first
time, and the curtain rose on the first act of that
"tragedy of the tomb," as Condivi appropriately
calls it, by which the rest of Michelangelo's life
was darkened.
</p>

<p>
He had no sooner arrived in Florence than he
received an imperative order from the Pope to
return immediately to Rome under pain of his
displeasure, but Michelangelo's blood was up, and
he disregarded alike the threats of the Pope and
the exhortations of Piero Soderini, who was greatly
embarrassed, having received three official Briefs
from Julius II., demanding that the artist should
be sent back either by fair means or by force.
Fearing actual violence, Michelangelo had made
up his mind to go to Constantinople, but the
Gonfaloniere dissuaded him, saying "that it was
better to die with the Pope than to live with the Turk."
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, Julius II., after subduing
Perugia, had entered Bologna in triumph on
November 11th, 1506, and he had not been many
days in the town before he despatched another
urgent message to the Signoria asking for Michelangelo
to be sent to him.  The artist finally gave
in, and proceeded to Bologna, armed with a most
flattering letter from the Signoria, but feeling
"like a man with a halter round his neck."  His
misgivings, however, were unfounded, for Julius
II., who was only too glad to have won his artist
back, welcomed Michelangelo most cordially and
commissioned him to make a great portrait statue
of him in bronze, to be placed in front of the church
of San Petronio.  And thus were these two men,
who had so many points in common that they
regarded each other with mutual fear, like giants
conscious of their strength, reconciled for the
time.

THE CREATION OF MAN.
</p>

<p>
The Pope returned to Rome in very good
spirits, leaving Michelangelo in Bologna to finish
the colossal statue, which was only completed
on February 21st, 1508, after much hard work
and many disappointments, chiefly caused by
the ignorance of the bronze-founder, who cast it
faultily.  It is greatly to be regretted that this
work, which cost Michelangelo over a year of
unremitting labour, should have been destroyed
in 1511, when the Bentivogli returned to Bologna
and drove out the Papal Legate.  A huge cannon,
ironically called La Giulia, was cast out of the
broken fragments.  Michelangelo, having
completed his task, hurried back to Florence, and
three days after his arrival Messer Lodovico
emancipated his son from parental control, as we
learn from a document dated March 13th, 1508.
</p>

<p>
It appears that Michelangelo intended to settle
down for several years in his native city in order
to decorate the Sala del Consiglio, for which he
was to receive three thousand ducats, and to
carry out other important commissions, including
that of twelve statues of the Apostles for Santa
Maria del Fiore, but "his Medusa," as he called
Julius II., would not suffer him to remain in
peace, and summoned him to Rome.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3b">
THE SISTINE CHAPEL
</p>

<p>
The artist obeyed, hoping that the Pope would
allow him to go on with the tomb, but, during
his absence, Michelangelo's rivals had persuaded
Julius II. that it was unlucky to have a monument
erected during his lifetime, and that it would be
much better to set Michelangelo to work on the
vault of the Sistine Chapel.
</p>

<p>
This they did maliciously, because they never
suspected that Michelangelo was as great a
painter as he was a sculptor, and hoped that
he would prove himself inferior to the task, and
thus lose the Pontiff's favour.  "All the
disagreements which I have had with Pope Julius," wrote
Michelangelo to Marco Vigerio, "have been
brought about by the envy of Bramante and of
Raphael of Urbino," who were the cause that his
monument was not finished during his lifetime.
Bitter, unscrupulous rivalry was the leper-spot
that marked the Italian Renaissance, especially
at the Papal Court.
</p>

<p>
Michelangelo would gladly have declined the
commission, for which he considered himself unfit,
but, seeing the Pope's obstinacy, he reluctantly
set to work on May 10th, 1508.  The difficulties
which he had to surmount were enormous, but he
was not a man to be frightened by obstacles,
however formidable.  Knowing little or nothing of
the technicalities of fresco painting, Michelangelo
at first called six Florentine painters to his aid,
including his old friends Francesco Granacci and
Giuliano Bugiardini.  But he was too exacting,
and aimed at an ideal of perfection which his
assistants could never attain, so that in January,
1509, he sent them all away, and destroying the
work done by them, shut himself alone in the
chapel to wrestle single-handed with his gigantic
task.
</p>

<p>
The result fully justified his confidence in his
own powers.  To attempt an adequate description
of the vault of the Sistine Chapel in this little
book would be a hopeless task.  The stupendous
frescoes which adorn it, although described in
hundreds of volumes, still afford material for
much original study and research, but we must
here content ourselves with a mere enumeration
of the principal motives which go to make up this
grand pictorial symphony.
</p>

<p>
Michelangelo chose for his subject the Story
of the Creation, the Fall of Man, the Flood, and
the Second Entry of Sin into the World, illustrated
by a series of nine compositions on the
central space of the ceiling.  Twenty magnificent
nude figures, representing Athletes, decorate
the corners of these central compositions, and
support bronze medallions held in place by oak
garlands and draperies.  The shape of the ceiling
is what is commonly called a barrel vaulting
resting on lunettes, six to the length and two to the
width of the building.  The second part of the
decoration demonstrates the need for a scheme
of Salvation, promised by the Prophets and Sibyls,
whose majestic figures are painted alternately in
the triangular spaces between the lunettes, in
the lower part of which is a series of wonderful
groups representing the ancestors of Christ.
</p>

<p>
Michelangelo, although engaged on a great
pictorial work, never considered himself as
anything but a sculptor, and followed in painting
the same systems that he would have adopted in
his own art.  Sir Charles Holroyd, in his recent
most valuable contribution to Michelangelesque
literature, very justly remarks: "When Pope
Julius prevented Michelangelo from going on with
his beloved project of the tomb and made him
paint the vault, the master set to work to produce
a similar conception to the tomb in a painted
form.  The vault became a great temple of
painted marble and painted sculptures raised
in mid air above the walls of the chapel.  The
cornices and pilasters are of simple Renaissance
architecture, the only ornaments he allowed
himself to use being similar to those he would have
used as a sculptor.  Acorns, the family device
of the della Rovere, rams' skulls, and scallop
shells, and the one theme of decoration that
Michelangelo always delighted in&mdash;the human
figure.  The Prophets and Sibyls took the positions
occupied by the principal figures designed
for the tomb, like the great statue of Moses.
The Athletes at the corner of the ribs of the roof
were in place of the bound captives, two of which
are now in the Louvre, and the nine histories
of the Creation and the Flood fill the panels like
the bronze reliefs of the tomb."
</p>

<p>
Michelangelo must have toiled with almost
superhuman energy at his great work.  In a letter
to his favourite brother, Buonarroto, dated
October 17th, 1509, he writes: "I live here in great
distress and with the greatest fatigue of body,
and have not a friend of any sort, and do not
want one, and have not even enough time to eat
necessary food."  This is not surprising when we
remember that as early as the 1st of November,
1509, the first and most important part of this
colossal work, which comprises three hundred
and ninety-four figures, the majority ten feet high,
was exposed to view, and greatly admired by the
Pope, who, being vehement by nature and
impatient of delay, insisted upon having it
uncovered, although it was still incomplete.
</p>

<p>
Such was the impatience of Julius II. that on
one occasion he threatened to have Michelangelo
thrown down off the scaffolding if he did not
hasten the completion of the work, and even
went so far as to strike the artist with a stick.
Thus urged, Michelangelo uncovered his work
on the 1st of November, 1512, although he used
to say in after years that he had been prevented
by the hurry of the Pope from finishing it as he
would have wished.  "Michelangelo's fame and
the expectation they had of him," says Condivi,
"drew the whole of Rome to the chapel, whither
the Pope also rushed, even before the dust raised
by the taking down the scaffolding had settled."
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3b">
SECOND FLORENTINE PERIOD
</p>

<p>
Julius II. died on February 21st, 1513, four
months after the completion of the great work with
which his name will remain as indelibly associated
as that of Michelangelo.  Shortly before his death
he had ordered that the tomb which Michelangelo
had begun should be finished, and had
instructed his nephew, Cardinal Aginense, and
Cardinal Santi Quattro, to see that everything
should be carried out according to the original
designs.  But his executors, finding the project
far too grand and expensive, had it altered, so
that Michelangelo began all over again.
</p>

<p>
He set to work with great energy and goodwill,
determined to finish the monument now that its
completion appeared to him almost as a sacred
debt to the memory of his dead patron.  But the
strange fatality that presided over the tragedy
of the tomb again interfered.  Cardinal Giovanni
de' Medici, who had been Michelangelo's friend
and fellow-pupil at the Medicean Court, succeeded
Julius II. on the pontifical throne and assumed
the name of Leo X.  No sooner were the magnificent
festivities over with which he celebrated
his accession, than he sent for Michelangelo and
ordered him to proceed to Florence to ornament
the façade of San Lorenzo with sculpture and
marble work.  It was in vain that Michelangelo
protested, saying that he was bound by contract
to finish the tomb before undertaking any other
commission, for Leo X. was as self-willed and
imperious as his predecessor, and "in this fashion,"
says Condivi, "Michelangelo left the tomb and
betook himself weeping to Florence."
</p>

<p>
It is not surprising that the artist should have
wept tears of bitter disappointment, for we learn
from a letter to his brother Buonarroto, dated
June 15th, 1515, that at this time not only had he
completed the Moses and the Captives in marble,
but the panels in relief were ready for casting.
Had he been left in peace, Michelangelo would
certainly have finished the monument to Pope
Julius in its modified form in half the time which
he wasted quarrying marble from Carrara and
Pietrasanta for the façade of San Lorenzo.  For
over two years Michelangelo was engaged in the
tedious work of roadmaking and quarrying.  In
August, 1518, he wrote: "I must be very patient
until the mountains are tamed and the men are
mastered.  Then we shall get on more quickly.
But what I have promised, that will I do by some
means, and I will make the most beautiful thing
that has ever been done in Italy if God helps me."
</p>

<p>
He had evidently warmed to his work, and it is
melancholy to think that Fate again interposed to
prevent its completion.  Giuliano de' Medici, the
Pope's only brother, and Lorenzo, his nephew,
having died at this time, Leo X. ordered
Michelangelo to interrupt the façade of San Lorenzo
and to build a new sacristy in which he proposed
to erect a monument to their memory.  The
document exonerating Michelangelo from all
duties and obligations in connection with the
façade is dated March 10th, 1520.
</p>

<p>
Michelangelo only now found time to carry out
a commission which he had received seven years
previously from a Roman gentleman, Metello
Vari, namely a nude statue of Christ bearing the
cross.  It was finished in the summer of 1521 and
sent to Rome, the extremities being left in rough
to prevent their being broken during the journey.
Pietro Urbino accompanied the statue to Rome,
with orders to complete it, and very nearly spoiled
it by his careless and inferior workmanship.  The
<i>Risen Christ</i>, now in the church of the Minerva,
is one of the most noble and majestic of religious
statues in existence; the torso and arms are
particularly fine, but the hands and feet, which were
spoiled by Urbino, are stumpy and defective.
</p>

<p>
Leo X.'s pontificate, which, although short,
was one of the most glorious and eventful in the
history of art, came to an abrupt conclusion on
December 1st, 1521.  By a strange irony of fate,
the magnificent patron of art and letters was
succeeded by a pious and simple-minded Dutch
prelate, who regarded statues as pagan idols,
and said that the Sistine Chapel was "nothing
but a room full of naked people."  There is little
doubt that he secretly longed to have it
whitewashed.  Fortunately for art and artists, his
pontificate was of brief duration, and in 1523
Cardinal Giulio de' Medici was elected in his
stead, under the name of Clement VII.
</p>

<p>
In the following year Michelangelo finished the
new sacristy of San Lorenzo, and immediately set
to work on the Medicean tombs.  But he was
constantly worried and interrupted by new
commissions from the Pope, who wanted him, among
other things, to build a library in which to place
the famous collection of books and manuscripts
begun by Cosimo de' Medici: "I cannot work
at one thing with my hands and at another with
my brain!" exclaimed the artist in despair.
Nevertheless he undertook to build the library,
and carried on both works at the same time,
constantly urged on by Pope Clement, who wrote
to him in an autograph letter: "Thou knowest
that Popes have no long lives, and we cannot
yearn more than we do to behold the chapel
with the tombs of our kinsmen, and so also the
library."
</p>

<p>
These were troublous times for Italy.  After the
disastrous battle of Pavia, in which he had lost
everything "except honour," Francis I. concluded
with the Sforza of Milan, with Venice, Florence,
and Pope Clement VII. a league against Charles
V., which proved fatal to all who took part in it.
In 1527, a rabble of German and Spanish soldiers
of fortune, led by the renegade Connétable de
Bourbon, took and pillaged Rome, and the Pope
himself was besieged in the Castle of Saint Angelo
for nine months.  The Florentines availed themselves
of this opportunity to shake off the despotic
yoke of the Medici, but two years later, Charles
V. concluded the peace of Barcelona with Clement
VII., one of the conditions being that he should
re-establish the Medicean rule in Florence.  But
the citizens would not give up their newly-acquired
liberty without a struggle, and prepared for a
desperate resistance.  Michelangelo was appointed
Commissary-General of defence, and showed himself
worthy of the confidence placed in him by
his fellow-citizens.
</p>

<p>
It was in a great measure due to the skill with
which he fortified the town, and more especially
the hill of San Miniato, that Florence was enabled
to withstand the attacks of the Imperial troops
for twelve months.  But the treachery of
Malatesta Baglioni, who commanded the troops of the
Republic, paralyzed the efforts of Michelangelo
and of its other brave defenders, and in August,
1530, the city fell.  Alessandro de' Medici returned
in triumph to Florence, and would certainly have
beheaded Michelangelo, who only saved himself
by hiding in the bell-tower of San Nicolò beyond
the Arno, until the first fury of his enemies was
over.
</p>

<p>
In spite of his important military duties,
Michelangelo continued working at the Medicean
tombs during the siege, and also painted a
panel picture, representing <i>Leda and the Swan</i>,
originally intended for the Duke of Ferrara, but
which he afterwards gave to his pupil Antonio
Mini, together with many cartoons and drawings,
that he might dower two sisters with the proceeds.
It was sold to the King of France and hung
at Fontainebleau until the time of Louis XIII.,
one of whose ministers ordered it to be
destroyed as an improper picture.  According to
another version, however, it was only hidden,
and afterwards brought to England.  The <i>Leda
and the Swan</i> now in the National Gallery is
regarded by some as the damaged and much
restored original of Michelangelo's famous
picture.  Clement VII.'s anger soon abated, and
Michelangelo was able to return to his work,
thanks chiefly to the kind offices of Baccio Valori,
the Papal envoy in Florence, to whom the
sculptor presented, out of gratitude, the fine
statue of <i>Apollo,</i> now in the National Museum at
Florence.
</p>

<br>
TOMB OF LORENZO DE' MEDICI.
</p>

<p>
The Medicean tombs progressed but slowly,
for all this time Michelangelo was worried
almost to death by the Duke of Urbino, a nephew
of Julius II., who insisted upon his finishing the
famous tomb, while Clement VII., on the other
hand, threatened the artist with excommunication
if he neglected his work in the new sacristy
for anything else.  Probably the first statue to
be finished was the beautiful Madonna suckling
the Child Jesus, represented as a strong boy
straddling across her knee.  It is one of Michelangelo's
noblest works, possessing all the majestic
simplicity of his earlier Madonnas enhanced by
greater power.
</p>

<p>
To give an adequate description of the tombs
of Giuliano and Lorenzo de' Medici would be
impossible within the narrow limits of this little
book.  Suffice it to say that the princes are
represented in the garb of ancient warriors, each seated
in a niche above a sarcophagus, on which two
allegorical figures recline.  Lorenzo appears to
be plunged in sorrowful meditation; at his feet
recline the colossal statues of <i>Evening</i>,
represented by a powerful male figure, apparently on
the point of falling asleep, and <i>Dawn</i>, symbolized
by a beautiful young woman in the act of awaking,
not to joy and hope, but to another day of
sorrow.  The beauty of this last figure cannot be
described; it is such as the imagination of the
ancient Greeks might have endowed a goddess
with.  The statue of <i>Dawn</i> was finished in 1531,
soon after the fall of Florence and the return
of the Medici, and there is little doubt that
Michelangelo intended his mournful figures to
express sorrow at the loss of Florentine liberty,
rather than at the death of the two young
princes.  The same idea is evident in the tomb
of Giuliano, with the two figures of <i>Night</i>,
symbolized by a sleeping woman of singular beauty and
power, and <i>Day</i>, a vigorous bearded giant just
rising to his work and looking over his shoulder
as if dazzled by the glare of the rising sun.
Although the head of <i>Day</i> is unfinished, it is a
striking example of how Michelangelo was able
to give life and expression to his work from the
first stroke of his chisel.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3b">
THE LAST JUDGMENT
</p>

<p>
In 1534 Michelangelo left Florence for the
last time.  His proud and independent spirit was
unable to tolerate Alessandro's petty tyranny.
The unfinished bust of Brutus, now in the
Bargello, a vigorous and striking piece of work, is
another proof of his intense longing for liberty.
On arriving in Rome he found that Clement VII. had
died two days previously, and that Paul III.,
Farnese, had been elected Pope.
</p>

<p>
Michelangelo had finally come to an understanding
with the executors of Julius II., the
agreement being that he should make a tomb with
one façade only, using the marbles already carved
for the quadrangular tomb and supplying six
statues from his own hand, the rest of the work to be
completed by other artists under his supervision.
He therefore hoped to finish the tomb which had
embittered thirty years of his life, but once more
he was doomed to disappointment, for Paul
III. immediately appointed him chief architect,
sculptor and painter of the Vatican, with a pension of
1,200 golden crowns, and ordered him to carry
out a commission which Clement VII. had given
him shortly before his death.  It was no less a
task than to paint the end wall of the Sistine
Chapel.  Prayers and remonstrance were alike
unavailing, and the doors of the Sistine closed
once more upon the master, not to be opened
again until the Christmas of 1541, when his
<i>Last Judgment</i> was uncovered "to the admiration
of Rome and of the whole world."
</p>

<p>
Thirty years earlier Michelangelo had depicted
the Creation on the vault of this same chapel;
he now took for his subject the final doom of all
things created.  The colossal work which cost
him eight years' labour is a magnificent but almost
terrifying pictorial rendering of the <i>Dies Irae</i>,
the Day of Wrath, when "even the just shall not
feel secure."  Awe and terror are equally apparent
among the spirits of the blessed crowding round
the dread Judge, and on the despairing countenances
of the condemned souls dragged down by
hideous demons towards the infernal river, where
Charon in his boat "beckons to them with eyes
of fire and beats the delaying souls with uplifted
oar."  The rendering of the subject is thoroughly
Dantesque, and very different from the conventional
treatment of the same theme by all preceding
artists.  The composition, however, and indeed
several individual groups and figures, remind
us forcibly of the Campo Santo at Pisa.
</p>

<p>
Although all true artists received this work with
enthusiasm, as Vasari says, and came from every
part of Italy to study it, Michelangelo's enemies,
including Pietro Aretino, the most immoral writer
of his age, criticised it as a highly improper
painting, because most of the figures were nude.  So
incensed was Michelangelo at this that he
revenged himself by painting one of his critics,
Messer Biagio da Cesena, as Minos surrounded
by a crowd of devils.  Some years later Paul
IV. obtained Michelangelo's consent to partly drape
most of the figures, and the work was done with
commendable discretion by Daniele da Volterra,
who thereby earned the nickname of Il Braghettone,
or the breeches-maker.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately the smoke from the altar candles
and censers, and the dust of centuries have
darkened and almost completely destroyed the
original colour of this fresco; ominous cracks
have also appeared in several places, but it is to
be hoped that time will spare one of the greatest
masterpieces of modern art for many centuries
to come.
</p>

<p>
No sooner had Michelangelo finished the <i>Last
Judgment</i>, than Paul III. set him to work on the
side walls of the chapel which Antonio da San
Gallo had just completed, and which is now
known as the Cappella Paolina.  Michelangelo
was nearly seventy years old at this time, and
fresco painting over a large surface is a fatiguing
task even for a young man, but the veteran artist
obeyed, and in 1549 he completed what was to
be his last pictorial work, the two frescoes
representing the <i>Conversion of St. Paul</i> and the
<i>Martyrdom of St. Peter</i>.
</p>

<p>
The composition of these pictures is as masterly
as ever, and the drawing, especially in the
fore-shortened figures, faultless, but for the first time
we are aware of something cold and unnatural,
very different from the glorious life and power with
which the frescoes of the Sistine literally glow.
Michelangelo was getting old, and even his
Titanic frame could not withstand the insidious
attacks of time.  He was seventy-five years of age
when he carried these frescoes to completion, and
he himself confessed to Vasari that he did so
"with great effort and fatigue."  Nevertheless he
found sufficient time and strength to complete
the famous monument of Pope Julius II. during
the intervals of his fresco painting, and in 1545
the tragedy of the tomb finally came to an end.
</p>

<p>
It must have been with feelings of mingled
relief and bitterness that Michelangelo surveyed
the much modified tomb in the church of San
Pietro in Vincoli.  The mighty design which had
fired his youthful ambition forty years previously
had dwindled down to a comparatively unimposing
monument, but everybody will agree with
Condivi when he says that "although botched
and patched up, it is the most worthy monument
to be found in Rome, or perhaps in the world;
if for nothing else, at least for the three statues
that are by the hand of the master."  Of the
central figure, representing Moses, we shall have
occasion to speak later on; the remaining statues
by Michelangelo to which Condivi alludes are
two female figures of rare beauty, representing
Active and Contemplative Life.  The rest of the
tomb was finished by Raffaello da Montelupo
and by other assistants under the master's supervision.
</p>

<p>
Having, as best he could, fulfilled his sacred
pledge to the memory of Julius II., Michelangelo
appeared to consider his artistic career as
practically at an end.  He was always inclined to
sadness, but a cloud of deeper melancholy seemed
to settle over him, and like Titian, Tintoretto,
and other artists who attained to great old age,
he turned his thoughts almost exclusively to
religious speculation.  In one of his sonnets he
beautifully expresses the yearning for peace and
rest which had taken possession of his
storm-tossed soul:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Painting nor sculpture now can lull to rest<br>
  My soul, that turns to His great love on high,<br>
  Whose arms to clasp us on the Cross were spread.[<a id="chap04fn2text"></a><a href="#chap04fn2">2</a>]<br>
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap04fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap04fn2text">2</a>] "The Sonnets of Michelangelo."  By J. A. Symonds,
No. lxv.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
Henceforward he regarded his art as a devotional
exercise more than anything else.  The unfinished
marble group of the <i>Deposition</i>, now in the
Duomo at Florence, and which he intended
should be placed over his tomb, was carved by
the master during these years of serene
preparation for his approaching end.
</p>

<p>
Throughout his long and laborious career,
devoted to the threefold worship of God, art and
his country, Michelangelo had constantly refused
to think of other ties, remarking that he had
"espoused the affectionate fantasy which makes of
art an idol."  From some of his sonnets, however,
it would appear that while at the court of Lorenzo
the Magnificent he had secretly cherished a deep
and hopeless passion for the beautiful Luigia de'
Medici, who died in 1494.  Forty years were to
elapse ere in his heart, yet youthful at the
approach of age, another woman, and she the first
of her era, Vittoria Colonna, occupied the place
left vacant by Luigia de' Medici.  The friendship
between these two lofty spirits, based upon
mutual admiration and esteem, is one of the
most beautiful romances in history, and inspired
Michelangelo with some of his finest poems.  It
was brought to a close in 1547 by Vittoria
Colonna's death, which left Michelangelo "dazed
as one bereft of sense."  "Nothing," says
Condivi, "grieved him so much in after years as that
when he went to see her on her death-bed he did
not kiss her on the brow or face, as he did kiss
her hand."
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3b">
ST. PETER'S
</p>

<p>
It will be remembered that Pope Julius II. had
ordered Bramante to rebuild the church of
St. Peter's on a more magnificent scale, in order
that his tomb should derive additional grandeur
from its stately surroundings.  Bramante was
succeeded by Raphael, Peruzzi and Antonio da
Sangallo, and when the latter died in October,
1546, Paul III. conferred the post of architect-in-chief
upon Michelangelo.  But the aged master
at first refused, saying that architecture was not
his art, and it was only when the Pope issued a
peremptory <i>motu proprio</i> that he set to work,
on condition that he should receive no payment
for his services.
</p>

<p>
Michelangelo returned to Bramante's original
design of the Greek cross, which had undergone
considerable alterations, his object being to erect
a perfectly symmetrical building in such a manner
that its dominant feature, both from within and
without, should be the cupola.  He began by
demolishing most of Sangallo's work, and severely
putting a stop to all jobbery, thereby creating a
number of enemies who did all in their power to
have him removed from his post.  But Julius III.,
who succeeded Paul III. in 1549, had implicit
faith in Michelangelo, and the colossal work
proceeded so rapidly, in spite of intrigues and
opposition, that in 1557 the great cupola was
commenced.
</p>

<p>
The master was now unable, owing to his extreme
old age, to personally superintend the building,
so that he constructed a wooden model, still
preserved at the Vatican, after which his
assistants carried on the work.  From the window of
his house Michelangelo used to watch for hours
together the huge cupola slowly rounding itself
against the sky, and wondered, perhaps, in how
many years after his death it would be finished.
The evening of Michelangelo's long life was
saddened by the loss of nearly all who were near
and dear to him.  His two remaining brothers
(for Buonarroto had died of the plague in 1528)
passed away in Florence, and the only
representative of the family, besides the aged artist,
was his nephew Leonardo, only son of his
favourite brother, Buonarroto.  Although a
confirmed bachelor himself, Michelangelo prevailed
upon his nephew to marry, and Leonardo
became the head of the still existing branch of the
Buonarroti family.  Another terrible loss to
Michelangelo was the death of his faithful
servant Francesco Urbino, of whom he wrote to
Vasari: "While Urbino living kept me alive, in
dying he has taught me to die, not unwillingly,
but rather with a desire for death.  The better
part of me has gone with him, and nothing is
left to me now but endless sorrow."
</p>

<p>
In spite of old age, illness and afflictions,
Michelangelo's last years were perhaps the busiest of a
life of uninterrupted work.  To this period must
be attributed the plan for the improvements upon
the Capitol; the design for the church of San
Giovanni del Fiorentini; the drawing for the
monument to Giangiacomo de' Medici which
Leone Leoni erected in the Milan Cathedral;
the plans for the conversion of the Baths of
Diocletian into the church of Santa Maria degli
Angeli, and a number of other drawings and
sketches for palaces, statues, monuments, which
other artists carried out.  He found time for all
these things while actively superintending the
construction of St. Peter's, and yet his restless
spirit was not satisfied.  In a beautiful sonnet,
beginning with the words
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Giunto è gia' il corso della vita mia,<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
he laments the loss of his former creative power,
and says that he has already felt the pangs of one
death, while another is fast approaching.  Nothing
could be more pathetic than the spectacle
of this strong creative spirit, already imprisoned
in the iron embrace of death, yet struggling,
like a Laocoon, against inevitable dissolution.
Although nearly ninety years of age, Michelangelo
would still walk abroad in all weathers, taking no
precaution whatever.  On February 14th, 1564,
a friend of the master, Tiberio Calcagni, met
him in the street on foot.  It was raining hard,
and Calcagni affectionately upbraided the old
man for going about in such weather: "Leave
me alone," cried Michelangelo fiercely, "I am ill,
and cannot find rest anywhere."
</p>

<p>
He spent the next four days in an armchair
near the fire, not complaining of any particular
suffering, "quite composed and fully conscious,"
as Diomede Leoni wrote to Leonardo, "but
oppressed with continual drowsiness."  In order
to shake it off, the brave old man tried to mount
his horse and go for a ride, but he was too weak.
Without a word he sat down again in his armchair,
and on the afternoon of February 18th,
1564, a little before five o'clock, Michelangelo
peacefully breathed his last.  "He made his will
in three words," says Vasari, "committing his
soul into the hands of God, his body to the
earth, and his goods to his nearest relatives."
</p>

<p>
Leonardo arrived in Rome three days after his
uncle's death.  He had some difficulty in
fulfilling Michelangelo's wish to be buried in his
native town, as the Romans, who had conferred
the citizenship on the artist, would not allow his
body to be removed.  At last the remains were
smuggled out of Rome in a bale of merchandise
and conveyed to Florence, where they were
buried with great pomp and solemnity in the
church of Santa Croce.  For some unaccountable
reason the group of the Pietà which Michelangelo
had intended for his monument, was not
placed over his tomb.  The present very ugly
monument was designed by Vasari at Leonardo's
request.  It bears the following inscription:
</p>

<p class="t3">

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Other monuments to Michelangelo exist in the
church of the Santissimi Apostoli at Rome, and
on the hill of San Miniato, overlooking Florence,
which he so bravely defended.  But the noblest
monument of Michelangelo the artist are his
undying works, and the highest praise of
Michelangelo the man and the Christian is contained
in these simple words of a contemporary, Scipione
Ammirato, "During the ninety years of his life,
and in spite of numberless temptations, Michelangelo
never did or said anything that was not
pure and great."

<h3>
THE ART OF MICHELANGELO
</h3>

<p>
In the history of Art, Michelangelo stands
isolated, a colossal figure looming terrible
and majestic, a Titan towering far above the
sons of men.  Yet his was an age of giants.
When Michelangelo came before the world the
glorious tide of the Renaissance was still rising;
sculpture and architecture had been brought to
an unprecedented degree of excellence by such
men as Lorenzo Ghiberti, Donatello and
Brunelleschi, and following in Masaccio's footsteps, a
host of great painters had successfully striven to
renovate and perfect their art until it culminated
in a Raphael.  Leonardo da Vinci was already
famous before Michelangelo had touched chisel
or brush, but neither Leonardo's encyclopaedic
achievements nor Raphael's meteorlike career
can be regarded as the ultimate expression, the
high-water mark of the Italian Renaissance.
</p>

<p>
In Michelangelo we behold the giant embodiment
of the true spirit of that wonderful period,
the synthesis of its various forms of beauty and
perfection, the final manifestation of its aesthetic
possibilities.  When Art first shook off the
trammels of mediaevalism, she was content to worship
at the shrine of Truth; with Botticelli and
Leonardo she passed into vague regions of poetry.
Raphael touched a more human note, often
soaring to sublime harmonies: with Michelangelo
the Renaissance reached its fullest
development, attaining to a spiritual height, an
almost superhuman loftiness hitherto undreamt
of.  Other men had excelled in painting, in
sculpture, or in architecture before him, but
Michelangelo was the first to attain perfection
in every branch of Art, and such was his strong
creative individuality that he left nothing to
which he applied himself at the same stage where
he had found it, bringing every manifestation of
Art to the highest degree of perfection of which
it was capable, and crowning all with that glorious
aureola of spiritual grandeur which is the
most awe-inspiring characteristic of his works.
</p>

<p>
We have said that Michelangelo stands alone.
Of other artists it is easy to trace the aesthetic
derivation, but he is the product of no school,
the result of no external influence.  Michelangelo,
the most perfect emanation of the Renaissance,
came before an astonished world like Minerva
leaping from the head of Jove, all armed and
beautiful in her strength and wisdom.
</p>

<p>
Although he lived in an age when tradition
was almost an artistic canon, and when the pupil
felt in duty bound to follow his master's methods,
even his early works reveal a singular originality
and freedom from all imitative tendencies.  Take
for instance his <i>Battle of the Centaurs and Lapithae</i>,
which he carved when working under Bertoldo
at the court of Lorenzo the Magnificent: it has
nothing in common with the school of Donatello,
but is instinct with the spirit of antique art,
showing that the young sculptor derived
infinitely more profit from the close study of the
antique masterpieces which Lorenzo had
collected in the gardens of San Marco than from
Bertoldo's precepts.  That he succeeded in
mastering the style and manner of the ancients to
perfection is proved by such works as the
<i>Sleeping Cupid</i>, now unfortunately lost, but which
was bought by Cardinal Riario as an antique,
and was the cause of Michelangelo's first coming
to Rome; the <i>Bacchus</i>, hardly inferior to the
<i>Dancing Faun of the Capitol</i>, and the beautiful
statues of the Medicean tombs, which might
easily be mistaken for the work of a Greek
chisel.
</p>

<p>
It is certain that during the first years of his
long sojourn in Rome he gave himself up
enthusiastically to the study of its ancient monuments
and works of art.  When the famous group of
the Laocoon was discovered in 1506, Michelangelo
greeted it as a "miracle of art," affirming
that the only statue worthy of being compared
with it was the torso of Hercules, which he was
never tired of drawing, and evidently had
before his mind when painting the magnificent
<i>ignudi</i> of the Sistine Chapel.  In the Wicar
Museum at Lille there are several copies by
Michelangelo of various decorative motives in
the Baths of Titus, showing how deeply he
studied ancient art even in minor details.  But
he was far from being a servile imitator; indeed
his powerful originality is never so strikingly
manifest as in those of his masterpieces which
appear to be conceived in a purely classical spirit.
</p>

<p>
Although deeply religious, even to the point
of regarding his art, especially during the latter
part of his life, more as a devotional exercise
than as a stepping-stone to glory, Michelangelo
had one essential point in common with Pagan
artists, namely, a boundless and reverent cult for
beauty in all its forms, and especially in its
highest and most wonderful manifestation, the
human frame.  "He loved the beauty of the
human body," says Condivi, "as one who best
understands it, and likewise every beautiful thing&mdash;a
beautiful horse, a beautiful dog, a beautiful
country, a beautiful plant, and every place and
thing beautiful and rare after its kind, admiring
them all with a marvellous love; thus choosing
beauty in nature as the bees gather honey from
the flowers, and using it afterwards in his
works."  In one of his sonnets Michelangelo thus
expressed his highest idea of beauty&mdash;man created
in the image of God:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Nor hath God deigned to show Himself elsewhere<br>
  More clearly than in human forms sublime,<br>
  Which, since they image Him, alone I love.[<a id="chap05fn1text"></a><a href="#chap05fn1">1</a>]<br>
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap05fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap05fn1text">1</a>] J. A. Symonds, "The Sonnets of Michelangelo and
Campanella," n. lvi. p. 90.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It is certain that he studied anatomy far more
deeply than any of his contemporaries, not
excluding Leonardo da Vinci, and devoted so
much time to dissecting that "it turned his
stomach so that he could neither eat nor drink
with benefit.  Nevertheless," adds Condivi, "he
did not give up until he was so learned and rich
in such knowledge that he intended to write a
treatise on the movements of the human body,
its aspect, and concerning the bones, with an
ingenious theory of his own, devised after long
practice."
</p>

<p>
Michelangelo has been accused by some critics,
not wholly without reason, of having somewhat
ostentatiously availed himself of his anatomical
knowledge.  In some figures of his <i>Last Judgment</i>,
for instance, the muscular masses, the
bones and tendons and other anatomical details
are hardly concealed by the skin, as if he had
painted from the <i>subject</i> on the dissecting-table
rather than from the living model.  The result
is undoubtedly striking and terrible, and we may
even hazard the conjecture that the master
purposely exaggerated his efforts in a picture
representing the final resuscitation of the flesh, the
awesome reconstruction and starting back into
life of bodies long since reduced to dust.  This
"stupendous defect," if such it may be called,
is far more apparent in Michelangelo's frescoes
than in his works of sculpture.
</p>

<p>
Having taken the human frame as the highest
possible standard of beauty, Michelangelo made
use of it in all his works not only as the principal
theme, but as a decorative element.  The ceiling
of the Sistine Chapel, with its magnificent nude
Athletes and allegorical figures, is the apotheosis
of the human frame as the noblest means of
decoration.  By introducing nude figures in his
tondo of the <i>Holy Family</i> and by his powerful
but utterly unconventional treatment of the
angels and saints in the <i>Last Judgment</i>, Michelangelo
once more affirmed his faith in the beauty
and purity of the "human form divine" as a
decorative element of religious art.  He went
even further, for in a letter to Cardinal Ridolfo
da Carpi, which he wrote when engaged on the
construction of St. Peter's, Michelangelo hazards
the strange theory that the study of the human
figure is indispensable not only to sculptors and
painters, but to architects as well: "For it is very
certain that the members of architecture depend
upon the members of man.  Who is not a good
master of the figure, and especially of anatomy,
cannot understand it."
</p>

<p>
Michelangelo's system of working was as
powerful and original as his art.  Before he began
a statue he could already discern the finished
masterpiece lurking within the rough-hewn block
of marble, which he would attack with reckless
assurance, great splinters flying in all directions
as he feverishly cut away the waste stone, and
saw the figure spring slowly into life under his
magic chisel.  A contemporary, writing in 1550,
when Michelangelo, then seventy-five years of
age, was carving the <i>Pietà</i> which he intended for
his tomb, thus describes the master at his work:
"I have seen him, although over seventy years of
age and no longer strong, cut away more
splinters from a block of very hard marble in
fifteen minutes than three young men could have
done in a couple of hours, and with such fierce
recklessness that I thought the whole work must
fall to pieces.  For he knocked off splinters the
size of a hand, following the line of his figures so
closely, that the slightest mistake would have
irreparably spoilt the whole group."
</p>

<p>
In one of his finest sonnets Michelangelo
mentions this wonderful gift of the true artist to
penetrate dull marble and to perceive, as through
a veil, the perfect work of art within:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Non ha l' ottimo artista alcun concetto<br>
  Ch' un marmo solo in se' non circoscriva<br>
  Col suo soverchio; e solo a quello arriva<br>
  La mano che ubbidisce all' intelletto.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Even such colossal works as the <i>David</i> were
carved by Michelangelo directly from the marble,
without previously modelling a full-size clay
figure.  In none of his finished masterpieces,
however, is it possible to observe Michelangelo's
methods better than in the unfinished statue of
Saint Matthew, now in the Academy, Florence,
which, although little more than a rough-hewn
block of marble, already reveals all the power
and beauty of the perfect work of art.  When
quarrying marble at Carrara for the façade of
San Lorenzo, he could tell to a nicety the exact
measurements of the blocks required, although
he had not yet prepared a model or even
accurate drawings to guide him in his work.  The
whole monument was already complete, even to
its minor details, in his mind.
</p>

<p>
Michelangelo followed the same strenuous
methods in painting.  We have seen that the
first part of his most colossal work, the vault of
the Sistine Chapel, comprising three hundred
and ninety-four figures, the majority ten feet high,
was begun on May 10th, 1508, and finished on
November 1st, 1509.  Indeed, as Michelangelo
may be said to have only commenced work in
earnest about the beginning of January 1509, after
dismissing his incapable assistants, it is far more
probable that the stupendous fresco was painted
in two hundred and thirty-four days, at the rate
of more than one figure a day.  The artist could
only paint on the plaster while it was wet, so that
it is easy to tell in how many days he finished
the larger figures by observing the divisions of
the separate days' plasterings.  For instance, Sir
C. Holroyd, whose judgment is thoroughly to be
depended upon, maintains that "one of the
largest and most prominent figures, as well as one
of the finest and most finished, the Adam in the
Creation of Man, was painted in three sittings
only.  The lines of the junctions of the plaster may
be seen in a photograph; one is along the collar
bone, and one across the junction of the body
and the thighs.  There is also a division all round
the figure, an inch or so from the outline, so we
know that the beautiful and highly finished head
and neck were painted in one day; the stupendous
torso and arms in another; and the huge
legs, finished in every detail, in a third.  Such
power of work and of finish is utterly inconceivable
to any artist of to-day."
</p>

<p>
Michelangelo rightly attributed his capacity
for rapid and finished work to the great pains he
had taken in thoroughly mastering the difficult
art of drawing.  There is a sketch in the British
Museum with the following piece of advice in
Michelangelo's own hand, to his pupil, Antonio
Mini:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  <i>Disegna Antonio, disegna Antonio, disegna, e non perder tempo.</i><br>
  Draw Antonio, draw Antonio, draw, and do not lose time.<br>
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-074"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-074.jpg" alt="CENTRAL GROUP OF THE LAST JUDGEMENT.">
<br>
CENTRAL GROUP OF THE LAST JUDGEMENT.
</p>

<p>
Like Donatello, he used to say to his pupils:
"I give you the whole art of sculpture when I
tell you&mdash;<i>draw</i>!"
</p>

<p>
Although it would be difficult to decide
whether he excelled most in painting or in
sculpture, Michelangelo, with singular modesty,
persisted in regarding himself as exclusively a
sculptor.  Even when engaged on his greatest
pictorial works, such as the frescoes of the
Sistine Chapel, he invariably signed his letters
with the words: Michelangelo, Scultore.  It is,
therefore, not surprising that his paintings, and
more especially his earlier works, were conceived
in a purely sculptorial spirit, and carried out
according to the methods of his favourite art.
The <i>Holy Family</i>, now in the Uffizi, for instance,
differs but little in treatment and composition,
from the two marble <i>tondi</i> in the Bargello, and
in the Royal Academy, and from what we know
of the famous <i>Cartoon of Pisa</i>, it is evident that
Michelangelo, when composing that famous
masterpiece, was influenced by the antique
bas-reliefs, representing battle scenes, which he had
seen and admired during his first visit to Rome.
</p>

<p>
That he did not consider himself a painter is
further shown by his utter disregard for colour,
so apparent in his earlier paintings, such as the
<i>Holy Family</i>.  But in the Sistine Chapel he
ceases to regard perfection of form as all sufficient,
and the sculptor suddenly becomes the greatest
colour-painter of any age.  For in these stupendous
frescoes, remarkable for their imposing, yet
extremely simple colour scheme, Michelangelo
has succeeded in making colour serve a higher
purpose than that of merely clothing his inspiration
with beautiful tints.  Colour is no longer an
accessory, but an integral factor as important as
the mighty figures, the inner meaning of which
it helps to bear out, and the result of as much
thought and care.  In no other work of art has
such perfect harmony of form and colour ever
been attained.
</p>

<p>
Michelangelo was so entirely absorbed in his
art, to the exclusion of every other thought or
passion, that it is possible to trace in his works
not only the gradual development of his genius,
but also the vicissitudes of his long and stormy
career.  Of his youthful works only two, the
bas-relief of the <i>Madonna and Child</i> in the
Buonarroti Collection and the <i>St. John</i> in the Berlin
Museum, bear evident traces of Donatello's
influence; in the <i>Battle of the Centaurs</i> and
<i>Lapithae</i> the young artist already asserts his
powerful individuality, and the <i>Bacchus</i> shows how
thoroughly he had become imbued with the
spirit of antique art.  It was not until he carved
the deeply religious group of the <i>Pietà</i> that he
revealed his spiritual personality, while in the
<i>David</i> we are first confronted with that
<i>terribilita</i> which is the most striking characteristic of
his subsequent works.  All Michelangelo's
masterpieces, whether of sculpture or painting, are
instinct with power and strength, like combatants
in some fierce, mysterious battle; but whereas
the youthful David appears to breathe forth a
triumphant defiance, his later conceptions, such
as the brooding athletes of the Sistine Chapel,
the Louvre captives writhing in their bonds, the
sombre giants of the Medicean tombs, and the
terror-stricken figures of the <i>Last Judgment</i>,
appear to be weighed down and overshadowed by
the consciousness of inevitable doom.  What was
formerly a brave, fearless fight becomes a
hopeless struggle of Titans against Fate.
</p>

<p>
Sublimity of conception, grandeur of form,
and breadth of manner are the elements of
Michelangelo's style.  As painter, as sculptor, as
architect he attempted&mdash;and above any other
man succeeded&mdash;to unite magnificence of plan
and endless variety of subordinate parts with the
utmost simplicity and breadth.
</p>

<p>
His line is uniformly grand; character and
beauty are admitted only as far as they can be
made subservient to grandeur.  The child, the
female, even meanness and deformity, are by
him indiscriminately stamped with grandeur.  A
beggar rises from his hand the patriarch of
poverty; the hump of his dwarf is impressed
with dignity; his women are moulds of generations;
his infants teem with the man; his men
are a race of giants.  In that sublime circle of
the Sistine Chapel which exhibits the origin, the
progress and the final dispensations of theocracy,
he may be regarded as the inventor of Epic
painting.
</p>

<p>
Among the glorious titles which have borne
the name of Michelangelo to so high a pitch of
celebrity, the least popular is that derived from
the composition of his poetical works.  The best
judges, however, regard these productions with
profound esteem.  For Michelangelo lived during
the "golden age" of the Lingua Toscana, and
among the poets who filled the interval between
the publication of the <i>Orlando</i> and that of the
<i>Aminta</i>&mdash;first, in order of date, of the poems of
Torquato Tasso&mdash;not one has raised himself
above, nor, perhaps, to the level of Michelangelo.
</p>

<p>
Michelangelo's architectural works reveal the
same characteristics which excite our admiration
when contemplating his paintings or his marbles,
namely, simplicity and grandeur.  Although he
always protested that architecture, like
painting, was not his profession, he stood head and
shoulders above Bramante or any other architect
of his time, and the majestic cupola of the
greatest temple in Christendom is a sufficient
proof of his genius.
</p>

<p>
Although Michelangelo left no school in the
narrower sense of the word, his influence upon
art, and, what is even more important, on the
minds of men, has undoubtedly been greater
than that of any other master, and successive
generations will agree with an illustrious
contemporary, Ariosto, in proclaiming him
</p>

<h3>
OUR ILLUSTRATIONS
</h3>

<p>
It is difficult to grasp all the sublime
significance of Michelangelo's works, even
when we find ourselves face to face with the
actual masterpieces, such as the frescoes of the
Sistine Chapel or the beautiful statues which
adorn the Medicean tombs.
</p>

<p>
To attempt an accurate description of his
principal works within the narrow limits at our
disposal would be indeed a hopeless task, especially
as the size of these pictures will only allow
of their conveying a somewhat remote idea of
the grandeur and awe-inspiring dignity which
are the principal characteristics of Michelangelo's art.
</p>

<p>
In selecting the following eight illustrations,
we have endeavoured not only to give an idea
of Michelangelo's gradual artistic development,
but also to throw some light on his powerful
and most interesting personality.  Although the
<i>Portrait</i> now in the Capitol Museum is in many
respects inferior to the one in the Uffizi, and has
even fewer claims to the honour of being
regarded as by the master's own hand, we have
selected it because it tallies perfectly with the
descriptions which Michelangelo's contemporaries,
and more especially Condivi and Vasari,
have left us of the master's rugged and expressive
features.  There is an aspect of profound
melancholy, almost of discouragement, in the
wan face, disfigured by the flattened nose; the
eyes are sunk deep under the massive and
somewhat slanting brow, and the whole picture has
an indescribably mournful, hopeless expression.
It was probably painted when Michelangelo was
about fifty-five years of age, and the tragedy of
the tomb was causing him bitter grief and
disappointment.  In the Uffizi portrait the most
interesting feature is the hand, strangely resembling
an eagle's talon and immediately giving the
impression of strong individuality and creative
power, which were Michelangelo's most striking
characteristics.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It has been rightly observed that nothing
closes the fifteenth century so fitly as the
magnificent marble group of <i>The Pietà</i>, which, although
carved by Michelangelo in 1498, already
prophesied the power of sixteenth-century art.
Numerous other artists had already been attracted
by the pathetic theme of the Virgin Mother
mourning over her dead Son, their principal aim,
however, being almost invariably to convey as
forcibly as possible to the beholder the grief and
despair of the bereaved Mother.  With characteristic
originality Michelangelo departed from
the traditional manner, successfully endeavouring
to give the theme a simpler but far more
dignified and lofty interpretation.  The Madonna
is seated on the stone upon which the Cross is
erected, with her dead Son on her lap.  Her
beautiful face is not contracted with grief, but
wears an expression of sublime peace and
resignation, and the graceful head reclines slightly
on her right shoulder, as if pitying Heaven had
sent sleep to temper the extremity of her grief,
and sweet dreams of the past, when the Virgin
Mother fondled her Infant Son, had mercifully
cancelled the horrible vision of the Redeemer's
lifeless body now lying on her lap.
</p>

<p>
Michelangelo's contemporaries criticised the
figure of the Madonna, remarking that the
Mother is far too young compared with the Son.
"One day," writes Condivi, "as I was talking
to Michelangelo of this objection, 'Do you not
know,' he said, 'that chaste women retain their
fresh looks much longer than those who are not
chaste?  And I tell you, moreover, that such
freshness and flower of youth, besides being
maintained in her by natural causes, it may
possibly be that it was ordained by the Divine
Power to prove to the world the virginity and
perpetual purity of the Mother.  It was not necessary
in the Son, but rather the contrary, wishing
to show that the Son of God took upon himself
a true human body subject to all the ills of man,
excepting only sin.  Do not wonder then that I
have, for all these reasons, made the most Holy
Virgin, Mother of God, a great deal younger in
comparison with her Son than she is usually
represented.  To the Son I have allotted His full
age.'"  This grave theological statement gives us
an interesting insight into Michelangelo's pious
and meditative character, showing how earnestly
he took his art and how reverently he thought
out every detail, especially when interpreting
some religious theme.
</p>

<p>
The figure of the dead Redeemer is, if possible,
even more admirable than that of the Mother.
"He is of so great and so rare a beauty," exclaims
Condivi, "that no one beholds it but is moved
to pity.  A figure truly worthy of the humanity
which belonged to the Son of God."  No other
sculptor has ever succeeded in giving marble the
absolute <i>abandon</i> of death quite so pathetically
as Michelangelo has done in this <i>Dead Christ</i>.
Here it was that his profound knowledge of
anatomy, and the long hours spent over the
dissecting table at Santo Spirito, first stood him
in good stead.  In the Albertina Gallery at
Vienna there is a magnificent study of a subject
placed in almost exactly the same position as the
Dead Christ, which the sculptor evidently
transferred to <i>The Pietà</i>, if indeed he did not make
the sketch expressly for this group.  Although
Michelangelo always professed to be a sculptor
and nothing else, he shows all a true painter's
sensitive appreciation of light and shade in this
work, having so arranged the graceful, but
somewhat complicated folds of the Madonna's
draperies, as to form a comparatively dark background
which enhances the whiteness of the lifeless body
lying on her lap.
</p>

<p>
To students of Michelangelo's art this work
is especially interesting as it shows the master
equally free from the influence of his Florentine
predecessors, and from that of the antique.
Michelangelo was conscious of the merit and of
the originality of this group, for it is the only
one which he considered worthy of bearing his
great name.

<p>
The <i>David</i>, now in the Accademia at Florence,
inaugurates the series of Michelangelo's colossal
statues.  It will be remembered that the master
undertook to utilize a huge block of marble
already rough-hewn by an unskilful sculptor,
and that he succeeded in hewing this magnificent
statue, without adding any other piece at
all, so exactly to the size that the old surface of the
marble may still be seen on the top of the head
and in the base.  What most surprises the modern
artist when studying not only this, but all
Michelangelo's colossal works, both in painting
and in sculpture, is the perfect finish of every
detail.  The fearless eyes, the shapely ear, the
firm set mouth, the powerful hand nervously
grasping the death-dealing missile, could not
have been more carefully modelled in a statuette,
and casts of each individual limb are still set
before students to copy and admire in every
studio of the world.
</p>

<p>
In 1501, when Michelangelo began this work,
he was still free and unfettered, justly proud of
the fame which his <i>Pietà</i> had brought him, and
with the world literally at his feet.  This young
giant boldly taking aim at an unknown but
formidable enemy, might well be regarded as an
allegorical representation of the artist himself,
on the eve of grappling with his fate.  It may
be taken for certain that a quarter of a century
later he would have interpreted the same theme
very differently, and would perhaps have given
us David the King, or David the Psalmist and
the Prophet, instead of this magnificent
embodiment of conscious power and hope.  The fierce
frown, the expression of strenuous force victoriously
struggling against overwhelming odds, all
those characteristics, in short, which have been
summed up in the word <i>terribilità</i> by his
contemporaries, would have been replaced by the
sombre majesty of the <i>Moses</i>, or the despairing
expression of conquered, impotent strength which
is the key-note to such works as the Medicean
Tombs, the Louvre Captives, and the <i>Last
Judgment</i>.  Critics casting about for an artistic
derivation of Michelangelo's earlier works
maintain that the <i>David's</i> face bears a resemblance
to the features of Donatello's Saint George in Or
San Michele, but the type is far more virile and
energetic, recalling, if anything, the masterpieces
of ancient art.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The <i>tondo</i> representing <i>The Holy Family</i>, now
in the Tribuna of the Uffizi, is doubly interesting
as a work of art and as an instance of Michelangelo's
fearless originality.  It was painted about
the year 1503 for that Florentine merchant prince,
Angelo Doni, who sat for his portrait to the
divine Raphael.  Although Signorelli had once
before introduced nude figures as a decorative
element in a Madonna and Child which he
painted for Lorenzo de' Medici (and it is
possible that Michelangelo saw this picture), no
other artist of the Renaissance had ever dared
to interpret a sacred subject such as the Holy
Family in so Pagan a spirit.  An ancient Greek
would quite naturally have supposed the beautiful
group in the foreground to represent Juno
playing with the infant Bacchus, only wondering,
perhaps, why the artist had neglected to place a
garland of vine leaves and clustering grapes
round the Wine God's curly head.  St. Joseph
might easily be taken for a momentarily uxorious
Jupiter or for a sober Silenus, and the nude
shepherds idling in the background place the
scene in a pleasant corner of Arcadia, while a
grinning little Faun does duty for St. John the
Baptist.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless there is not the slightest hint at
irreverence; it is merely a Pagan translation, by
a master hand, of an oft-repeated Christian
theme, a transposition as beautiful and as
harmonious in its way as the original score.
Indeed, Vasari tells us that Michelangelo painted
this strikingly original <i>tondo</i> merely "to show
his skill," and the magnificent modelling and
foreshortening of the Madonna's arms, the
masterful composition, and the wonderfully accurate
drawing more than achieve his object.  As to
the colouring, he entirely disregarded it in his
sculptor's pride.  He might as well have carved
this remarkable work in marble.  Before painting
the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, Michelangelo
appeared to be wilfully colour-blind, as if afraid
that painting would wile him away from the
sister art, to which he had plighted his troth.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
There is very little doubt that the original
design of the <i>Creation of Man</i> was inspired in
Michelangelo by one of the antique gems which
he admired as a boy in Lorenzo de' Medici's
collection.  A similar origin may be assigned to
the group of Judith and her maid, also in the
Sistine Chapel, to several of the Athletes, and
to the Leda and the Swan which he painted for
the Duke of Ferrara.  But this magnificent
recumbent figure of Adam far surpasses anything
in ancient as well as in modern art, and is
indeed a worthy centre round which the remaining
stupendous compositions appear to gravitate like
planets round the sun.  It is here, more than
in any other of his works, that we can appreciate
Michelangelo's wonderful gift of interpreting
the highest and most inaccessible themes in a
simple yet imposing manner.  Resting heavily
on the curved surface of the globe, his powerful
limbs and finely modelled flesh clearly outlined
against the indigo blue of the sky and the
solemn lines of the landscape, Adam gives one
the impression of a huge primeval being instinct
with strength which he is as yet unable to
understand or to use, and just awaking into life, a
divine spark of which he receives from the Deity.
Michelangelo's conception of God the Father, as
an old but powerful and majestic figure, has
ever since remained the only possible pictorial
symbol of so lofty a subject.

<p>
Apart from its great artistic merit, a pathetic
interest attaches to the statue of <i>Moses</i> because
it represents the last act of that tragedy of the
tomb which darkened the greater part of Michelangelo's
life, and influenced his art more than
any other circumstance of his eventful career.
</p>

<p>
The leader and law-giver of the Hebrews is
seated in an attitude of thought and wisdom,
holding under his right arm the tables of the
law, and supporting his chin with his left hand,
like one tired and full of cares.  His beard
escapes in long waves between the fingers of his
right hand.  The hands and strong bare arms of
the <i>Moses</i> are magnificent, beyond comparison
the finest ever modelled by Michelangelo.  The
expression of the face is one of commanding
power and almost fierce energy, a face capable of
inspiring terror rather than love, a veritable
embodiment of the cruel, uncompromising Hebrew
legislation.  The powerful, massive form is clearly
apparent beneath the beautiful folds of the
draperies, for here, as in all Michelangelo's clothed
figures, whether in painting or in sculpture, dress
does not hide but almost enhances the shape
and beauty of the body.  "This statue alone,"
exclaimed the Cardinal of Mantua, when he saw
the finished work, "is enough to honour the
memory of Pope Julius."

<p>
In the Medicean tombs Michelangelo may
be said to have equalled if not surpassed the
masterpieces of ancient sculpture.  We have
selected the tomb of Lorenzo de' Medici for
our illustration, as the statues which adorn it,
symbolizing <i>Evening</i> and <i>Dawn</i>, although
conceived in the same spirit of profound melancholy,
are, if possible, even more beautiful than
the Day and Night of Giuliano's tomb.  <i>Evening</i>
is represented by an old man, brooding and
dejected, but hardly less powerful and muscular
than the giant Day.  It is evident that he is not
suffering from bodily fatigue, but that he is
sinking under the weight of some unbearable,
irremediable calamity.
</p>

<p>
The virgin <i>Dawn</i> is perhaps the most beautiful
female figure of modern or of ancient art.
She is represented as only half awake and almost
unable to rise from her couch, while there is a
suggestion of ineffable bitterness in the expression
of the face with its half-closed eyes wearily
greeting another day of sorrow.  The powerful
yet graceful limbs are magnificently modelled,
and the whole figure may be regarded as the
perfection of the female form, redeemed from
any breath of sensuality by a commanding
loftiness of expression, such as the Greeks gave to
the statues of their goddesses.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Michelangelo's <i>Last Judgment</i> is a work of
so colossal a nature that it would be impossible
to give even a remote idea of the whole
composition in this unpretentious little book.  We
have therefore selected for our illustration the
central group representing Christ the Judge, a
dread figure enthroned on clouds, with hand
upraised in an attitude of stern command,
surrounded by the Blessed, who press round the
Son of God with eager, frightened looks and
gestures, as if hardly secure of their final
salvation in that terrible day of retribution, "cum vix
Justus sit securus."  Nestling timorously close to
her Son, half sitting, half crouching, with head
averted, as if to avoid seeing the coming wrath,
and arms crossed on her bosom, is the Mother
of God, a wonderfully sweet and pathetic figure,
full of pity and sorrow for the condemned souls,
and contrasting strangely with the inexorable
Judge rising in his stern majesty to pronounce
sentence on the frightened, shuddering mass of
humanity.  The action of the Judge, and indeed
every part of the composition, forcibly remind
us of the <i>Last Judgment</i> in the Campo Santo of
Pisa, but there is not a figure or a detail in the
whole of this colossal work which does not bear
the imprint of that powerful originality and
that wonderful gift to express the most varied
emotion and to interpret the loftiest themes,
which were the principal characteristics of
Michelangelo's genius.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
